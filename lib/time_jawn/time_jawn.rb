  module InstanceMethods
    # This method generates a series of methods on instances by calling the _generate_to_local and
    #  _generate_to_local_with_assignment that are private on teh parent class. The methods that are created are called
    # local_#{attribue} and local_#{attribute}= the attribute portion their names are completed by enumerating
    # the datetime_attributes of the class. Twice as many methods as there are DateTime attributes will 
    # be created.
    # 
    #    :created_at, and :updated_at
    #     
    #     local_created_at
    #     local_updated_at
    #     local_created_at=
    #     local_updated_at=
    # 
    # The local_#{attribue} methods will take the value stored in the attribute indicated by the methods name
    # and apply a time zone conversion to it. This is useful for displaying the local time (according to the object).
    # 
    # local_#{attribute}= methods are assignment shortcuts. They behave a little differently than you would expect.
    # They do not take a local time and convert it into utc (or whatever, ActiveSupport will handle that for us), 
    # what these assigment methods do is take any sort of string that looks like a time, or any sort of time or datetime 
    # object lop off whatever timezone is being fed in and glue the instances local timezone on the end before applying 
    # it to the appropriate attribute. This is convenient for some one in one time zone setting a value for an instance 
    # that represents a different time zone. For example:
    #
    #     I am in Philadelphia (EST), my application is set to UTC, and I want to set the time on an Alarm instance that 
    #     goes off in San Francisco (PST). I want that time to be 6PM. In Philadlephia I choose 6PM (local), the applications assumes I 
    #     meant 6PM UTC (2PM EST and 11AM PST). That is not what I intended, I intended on 6PM PST, and now my Alarm is all wrong.
    #     The assignment methods turn 6PM (set in EST, and processed in UTC) into 6PM PST (or 9PM EST, 1AM UTC) the expected time. The
    #     Alarm goes off as expected!*
    #
    #     *Times in this example may be wrong since I put them in myself.
    #
    # You can see examples of how these methods work in the specs folder.
